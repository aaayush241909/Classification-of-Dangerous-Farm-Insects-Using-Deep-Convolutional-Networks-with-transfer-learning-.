# Classification-of-Dangerous-Farm-Insects-Using-Deep-Convolutional-Networks-with-transfer-learning-.
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an effective and accurate classification system for identifying dangerous farm insects using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with transfer learning techniques. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in quickly and accurately identifying harmful insects, enabling timely and appropriate pest control measures.

Motivation
Insects pose a significant threat to crops and can cause substantial economic losses in agriculture. Identifying dangerous insects quickly and accurately is crucial for implementing effective pest management strategies. Traditional methods of insect identification are often time-consuming and require expert knowledge. By leveraging deep learning and transfer learning, this project aims to provide an automated and efficient solution to this problem.
